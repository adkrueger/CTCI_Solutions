'''
given two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit.
the digits are stored in /reverse/ order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list.
write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list

example:
input: (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). that is, 617 + 295
output: 2 -> 1 -> 9. that is, 912

follow up: suppose the digits are stored in forward order. repeat the above problem

example:
input: (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5). that is, 617 + 295
output: 9 -> 1 -> 2. that is, 912
